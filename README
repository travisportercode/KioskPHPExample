

NOT A FUNCTIONAL PHP SCRIPT (yet). This is just to show some an example php program I've written.

The project included is in a very early stage of development (like day one). 
The final project is live and looks much different. 
The final project also uses models and other shared classes on the server not part of this project.
My goal with this project is to move everything into the one project for easy portability and demonstration.


TODO:
* REFACTOR, REFACTOR, REFACTOR
* Move images to images folder or to the files folder for easier readability
* Test basic functionality
* Allow automatic demo if system is not connected to a MySQL database.
